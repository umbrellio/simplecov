Feature:

  Using SimpleCov.collate should get the user a coverage report

  Background:
    Given I'm working on the project "faked_project"

  Scenario:
    Given SimpleCov for Test/Unit is configured with:
      """
      require "setup_cucumber_feature_coverage"
      SimpleCov.start
      """

    When I successfully run `bundle exec rake part1`
    Then a coverage report should have been generated
    When I successfully run `mv coverage/.resultset.json coverage/resultset1.json`
    And I successfully run `rm coverage/index.html`

    When I successfully run `bundle exec rake part2`
    Then a coverage report should have been generated
    When I successfully run `mv coverage/.resultset.json coverage/resultset2.json`
    And I successfully run `rm coverage/index.html`

    When I open the coverage report generated with `bundle exec rake collate`
    Then I should see the groups:
      | name      | coverage | files |
      | All Files | 91.38%   | 6     |

    And I should see the source files:
      | name                                    | coverage |
      | lib/faked_project.rb                    | 100.00 %  |
      | lib/faked_project/some_class.rb         | 80.00 %   |
      | lib/faked_project/framework_specific.rb | 75.00 %   |
      | lib/faked_project/meta_magic.rb         | 100.00 %  |
      | test/meta_magic_test.rb                 | 100.00 %  |
      | test/some_class_test.rb                 | 100.00 %  |

      # Note: faked_test.rb is not appearing here since that's the first unit test file
      # loaded by Rake, and only there test_helper is required, which then loads simplecov
      # and triggers tracking of all other loaded files! Solution for this would be to
      # configure simplecov in this first test instead of test_helper.

    And the report should be based upon:
      | Unit Tests |
